Got it. Since **you can only read (no hands-on practice)**, I’ll teach you Photoshop in a **theory-first, visualization-based way**, like a textbook + mentor combined.

Here’s **how I will teach you**, then I’ll give you **ALL steps from Beginner → Pro** in advance so you can track progress.

---

## How the teaching will work (important)

* I will teach **one step at a time**
* Each step will be **explained deeply but clearly**
* I’ll use:

  * mental models (“imagine this like…”)
  * real-world examples
  * common beginner mistakes
* **After each step, I will stop and ask you to type `n`**
  → typing `n` means *“I’ve read and understood, move to next step”*

Even without hands-on, this method builds **conceptual mastery**, which is exactly how professionals think.
